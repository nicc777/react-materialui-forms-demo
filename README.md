# Demonstration of a React Web App using Material UI forms with react-hook-form

This demonstration was based on the blog entry of William Kurniawan titled "_[Building a simple login form with Material UI and React Hook Form](https://www.williamkurniawan.com/blog/building-a-simple-login-form-with-material-ui-and-react-hook-form)_"

I was looking for a simpler way to collect form data using Material UI and sofar this is my favorite. `react-hook-form` eliminates the need to keep form data in state and keeps your codebase light.

Some of the basic bootstrapping commands that was run prior to the project:

```bash
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ yarn add @material-ui/core
$ yarn add react-hook-form
```

## Quick Start

```bash
$ yarn && yarn start
```

If your browser did not automatically open, navigate to http://localhost:3000 

Enable your browser's development tools and watch the `console` output when you submit the form.
